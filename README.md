# React Native Inifinity

React Native Inifinity is a CLI that generates React Native projects for all platforms your app needs to support.

You can use the [interactive](https://silly-sinoussi-9c57cb.netlify.com) tool in the docs to generate the CLI command you need, or follow the API docs to create your own command.
